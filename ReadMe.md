### LANDSCAPE GENOMICS PIPELINE IN R ###
### PART 1 - GENETIC STRUCTURE AND GENETIC DIVERSITY ###

These suit of scripts were developed based on LanGen_pipeline from @rojaff/LanGen_pipeline

Scripts in R for different analyses of Landscape Genomics using SNPS, VCF, or Genind objects. These scripts perform the following steps:

<b>1.</b> SNPs dataset filtering using PCadapt, sNMF, and TESS3 to outlier detection.

<b>2.</b> Assessment of population genetic structure using sNMF, DAPC, TESS3, and PCA.

<b>3.</b> Creating maps for ancestry coefficients from step 2.

<b>4.</b> Estimate Tajima's D, genetic diversity and genetic distance inter and intra populations, and preparing the input for NeEstimator (Effective Population Sizes).
