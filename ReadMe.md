### LANDSCAPE GENOMICS PIPELINE IN R ###
 
REFERENCES AND MORE INFORMATION:

#A. BASED ON PIPELINE FROM LANGEN: https://github.com/rojaff/LanGen_pipeline
 
#B. THIS PIPELINE WAS DESIGNED IN UBUNTU 20.04 LTS, USING RSTUDIO 1.4.1717 AND R 4.1.0

#C. Script prepared by Carolina S. Carvalho, Jeronymo Dalapicolla, Luciana C. Resende-Moreira, Jamille C. Veiga, and Rodolfo Jaff√©



### PART 1 - GENETIC STRUCTURE AND GENETIC DIVERSITY ###

This suit of scripts were developed based on LanGen_pipeline from @rojaff/LanGen_pipeline

Scripts in R for different analyses of Landscape Genomics using SNPS, VCF, or Genind objects. These scripts perform the following steps:

<b>1.</b> SNPs dataset filtering using PCadapt, sNMF, and TESS3 to outlier detection.

<b>2.</b> Assessment of population genetic structure using sNMF, DAPC, TESS3, and PCA.

<b>3.</b> Estimate Tajima's D, genetic diversity and genetic distance inter and intra populations, and preparing the input for NeEstimator (Effective Population Sizes).
