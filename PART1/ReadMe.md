# Part 1 - Genetic Structure and Genetic Diversity

This suit of scripts were developed based on [LanGen_pipeline](https://github.com/rojaff/LanGen_pipeline)

&nbsp;
For a similar pipeline without using *VCFtools v.0.1.16*, check our [Populational Genomics Pipeline](https://github.com/jdalapicolla/PopGenPipe)

&nbsp;

## Scripts:
__1.1_FILTERING_SNPs.R__: SNPs dataset filtering using PCadapt, sNMF, and TESS3 to outlier detection.

__1.2_GENETIC_STRUCTURE.R__: Assessment of population genetic structure using sNMF, DAPC, TESS3, and PCA.

__1.3_GENETIC_DIVERSITY_DISTANCE_TAJIMAD.R__: Estimate Tajima's D, genetic diversity and genetic distance inter and intra populations, and preparing the input for NeEstimator (Effective Population Sizes).
